# Git Deployment Job
# ------------------
# In this scenario, the Azure DevOps does very little.
# Notice the deployment job does not even run `npm install`
# because Azure App Service will create the build
# automatically including installing all dependencies.
#
# This follows best practice of building an application
# for the target platform for consistent deployments. If
# you build locally (or on Azure DevOps) and your application
# has native bindings, you may get a false positive locally
# or in your CI build.
stages:
- stage:
  displayName: Git Deploy
  variables:
  # The credentials are application scoped and stored as
  # secrets in a Pipeline Library Group, which is configured
  # to restrict pipeline access.
  - group: git-deployment-credentials
  jobs:

  # A Git Deployment is only a `git push` to a git remote repo.
  # First you need to configure the remote with application
  # specific credentials (see "Deployment Center" in Azure Portal).
  #
  # Secondly CI/CD will often checkout applications in a
  # "detatched" HEAD state. We need to push that reference
  # (not a branch) to the deployment platform.
